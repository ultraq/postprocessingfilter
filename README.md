Post-Processing Filter
======================

Common code for a resource post-processing filter.  Has objects, an abstract
filter, and a resource response wrapper to help manage, track, and cache
post-processed resources in a Java web application.

Used by my LessCSS Filter and YUI Compressor Filter projects, not meant to be
used as a standalone project.
