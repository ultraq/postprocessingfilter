Post-Processing Filter
======================

Common code for a resource post-processing filter.  Has objects, an abstract
filter, and a resource response wrapper to help manage, track, and cache
post-processed resources in a Java web application.

Used by my [LessCSS Filter](https://github.com/ultraq/lesscss-filter) and [YUI Compressor Filter](https://github.com/ultraq/yuicompressor-filter)
projects, not meant to be used as a standalone project.
